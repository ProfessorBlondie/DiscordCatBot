# DiscordCatBot was requested by a fried to return a random picture of a cat when requested on the discord app. 

# If you'd like to add the bot to your discord the link is here:
# https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=935951137432027299&permissions=431644735552&scope=bot


# The code is stored and run on Replit here:
# https://replit.com/@ProfessorBlondi/CatBot#main.py

# It uses https://docs.thecatapi.com/ as a cat picture repository
# and uses https://uptimerobot.com/ to ping the bot so it doesn't shut down (Replit will stop running a code after 2 hours if it doesn't receive a ping)
